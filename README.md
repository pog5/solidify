## solidify.ps1
A powershell script for Windows 10+ that uses the registry and group policy to restrict access common dumb things that students do on school computers ~~(I'm sorry)~~, while also increasing privacy.

The script is small for now but it might grow. Please feel free to contribute freely.
It has many options inside it which you could (soon) set with command line arguments.
